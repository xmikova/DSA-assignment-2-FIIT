# DSA assignment 2, FIIT
A school assignment focused on creation of a BDD (Binary Decision Diagram) structure. This structure represents a certain Boolean function in a DNF form and we can evaluate it for all the possible logical inputs using the BDD. My implementation provides a function to create BDD, create BDD with best possible order so consisting of the minimal amount of nodes and a function to use the BDD for certain input of logical values of the variables. It also contains a test to ensure that the BDD is working 100 percent correctly.
